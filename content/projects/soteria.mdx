On February 2021, a military coup happened in my country Myanmar. Ever since then, Myanmar and its people has been facing with war and living under constant fear. However, the courgeous and diligent people of the country have been fighting back and have came up with many ways to help fight the junta's government and military. These includes donations and campaigns, applications and games, websites and channels all serving as income streams to fight agaisnt the junta. 

This website serves as booster for these income streams, curating them from unique sources so that users can help with everything in one place. Users can also add posts for donations and campaigns that they would think would be helpful. This site also used webscraping for displaying posts from websites and channels. I also developed a manager portal to manage new posts from users to check whether they are real or not and also to manage and delete outdated posts.
