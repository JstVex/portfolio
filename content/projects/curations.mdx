A lot of aspiring developers, designers and programmers from Myanmar face a challenge in finding resources to learn and improve their skills. They also have a hard time understanding what the resources and tools are about and how they can utilize them to their advantage. 

This website solves this problem by curating resources from various sources and providing a brief description of each resource in both English and Burmese. This website also tends to promote talents from Myanmar by showcasing their works and projects. Users can submit their own or any resources and projects to be featured on the website by filling out a form which is connected to our google sheet through the Google Sheet API.
